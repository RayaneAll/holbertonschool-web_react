# TypeScript Project - Foundations v2 - Part 3

This repository contains the solutions for the TypeScript project tasks as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Project Description

This project focuses on learning TypeScript fundamentals including:
- Basic types in TypeScript
- Interfaces, Classes, and functions
- DOM manipulation with TypeScript
- Generic types
- Namespaces
- Declaration merging
- Ambient namespaces
- Nominal typing

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Explain basic TypeScript types
- Work with interfaces, classes, and functions in TypeScript
- Manipulate the DOM using TypeScript
- Use generic types effectively
- Implement and use namespaces
- Merge declarations
- Import external libraries using ambient namespaces
- Understand basic nominal typing concepts

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files must end with a new line
- Files will be transpiled on Ubuntu 18.04
- TypeScript scripts checked with jest (version 24.9.*)
- README.md file is mandatory at the root
- Code should use .ts extension when possible
- No TypeScript compiler warnings or errors

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on different TypeScript concepts:

### Task 0: Creating an interface for a student
- Implement a Student interface
- Create student objects and render them in a table

### Task 1: Teacher interface and extensions
- Create a Teacher interface with optional attributes
- Extend the interface for Directors
- Implement printTeacher function
- Create StudentClass with specific methods

### Task 2: Advanced types
- Implement Director and Teacher interfaces
- Create employee factory function
- Type predicates and function overloading
- String literal types

### Task 3: Ambient Namespaces
- Create type declarations
- Work with ambient files
- Import and use third-party libraries

### Task 4: Namespace & Declaration merging
- Organize code using namespaces
- Implement declaration merging
- Create subject-specific classes

### Task 5: Brand convention & Nominal typing
- Implement branded types
- Create functions with nominal typing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to each task directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript files
5. Use `npm start` to run the development server (where applicable)

## Usage

Each task has its own specific requirements and usage patterns. Refer to the individual task directories for detailed instructions.
